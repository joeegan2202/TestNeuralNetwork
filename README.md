# My First Testing Neural Network

This is a super simple application of neural network principles.
I set up basic multidimensional arrays to hold weights, biases, and values.
In the future, I would not use this approach again. Especially in Java, I would define a neuron class to handle more of the forwards propogation and math involved.
Consequently, the code is a real mess, and all it does is create a network of 2 layers of 2 nodes each, to decipher whether a given input is greater than or less than 0.
This is beyond trivial, but it works, so....
